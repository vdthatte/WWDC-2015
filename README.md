# WWDC-2015

I was struck with an idea to participate in the competition to win tickets Apple's developer conference
WWDC - 2015. <https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/>

The app that I'd planned to build was a beacon service that alerted pre-set numbers when you reached a certain place.
This app uses users' Geo-location and messenger services to work. I used Apple's Mapkit to obtain the geo-location of the user.
With the limited time(of two days. yeah two) I could not complete it but I do plan to finish it soon as this could be a 
great boon for commuters who wish to convey messages to their loved ones when they reached a certain place. Transportation
services can also use this service to know when their customers arrive at a certain place so that they can make arrangements
to pick their customers in time.
